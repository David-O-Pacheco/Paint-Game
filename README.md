# Paint-Game

A painting game i have been working on since september/october 2019.

Small Description:
You paint using different colours, while avoiding collision with obstacles.

All code, artwork, animations, UI, models have been created/designed by myself (David Pacheco). Some of the code presented is still being used in the current game version.

Demo pictures of the game can be found inside (David-O-Pacheco / Paint-Game)
